# Vue 3 application with some lux components

This example application demonstrates importing
lux components into individual components in a Vue 3
application.  This allows vite to tree-shake
lux, packaging only the components it needs in the
bundle.

## Trying out this application in the browser

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

You can then see the application in your browser
at the port that vite provides.
